# 003: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters



Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

思路：

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        d = {}
        start,ans = 0,0
        for i,c in enumerate(s):
            if c in d and d[c]>=start:
                start = d[c]+1
            d[c]=i
            ans = max(ans, i-start+1)
        return ans
```
